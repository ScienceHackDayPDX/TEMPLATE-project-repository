Does your project involve people? A code of conduct can help you to get everyone on the same page. A template CoC is below, it's the one we used for the Science Hack Day event, feel free to edit it!

# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Science Hack Day PDX 2017 is to be inclusive of the largest number of contributors and participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. **We aim to be the most fun hackathon you've ever attended. As such, we take your safety very seriously.** We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, experience, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Science Hack Day Pdx 2017 to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and **positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society**.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. Tell an organizer!

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

*   Science Hack Day PDX is a unique professional experience -- we are all here to learn form each other and expect participants to show up be ready to engage.
*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, **even if they seem inconsequential**. We always want to know if something doesn't feel right, even if you're not 100% sure why.
*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public. Please be respectful to all visitors of these locations.
*   **Please take good care of the equipment and tools and follow directions. Some of them are very expensive. Misuse resulting in harm or breakage will result in immediate dismissal and possible further action.**

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

 The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Violence, threats of violence, depictions of violence, or violent commmunication directed against another person or a group of people.
*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language. 
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
*   Inappropriate photography or recording. Check name badges for people's preference to be photographed. When in doubt, ask. 
*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and sexual advances.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

**Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately and without protest**.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community **without warning** (and without refund in the case of a paid event). 

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify one of our two Safety Coordinators [one man and one woman, ideally people who have been in charge of CoC reporting in the past] as soon as possible. When in doubt, just reach out. We can talk it out and decide what action to take. 

Additionally, event organizers Safety Coordinators are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Science Hack Day PDX with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–-online and in-person–-as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business (Slack, Twitter, etc).

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
