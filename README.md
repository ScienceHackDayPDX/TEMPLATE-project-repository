# TEMPLATE-project-repository
1. Clone/Download or simply Fork this repository to kickstart documenting your Science Hack Day PDX 2017 project
- Once you have made your copy or fork, copy the address. It should look like this: https://github.com/yourGitHubName/TEMPLATE-project-repository 
- [Here](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/TEMPLATE-project-repository) is my fork of the repo if you want to check that out, note in the top left it says "forked from" and then the original location. 
- Once you have Forked it, you can edit the text in the files to add documentation about your project. But first...

2. We've all got issues...[Click here to create an Issue](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/Science-Hack-Day-PDX-2017/issues/new) in the [Science Hack Day](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/Science-Hack-Day-PDX-2017) repository, and fill out the form to link us to your project. 

3. Write a README.md document that describes your project. 
- What did you do?
- What equipment, tools, software, and/or hardware did you use?
- Who is this project for?
- Can others contribute to your project?
- Remember the confetti cannon - it's so sad when you find a confetti cannon but no one knows how to use it. Tradegies like these can be avoided by writing great documentation as you go!

4. Don't be shy about sharing your code, project plan, or designs! Open Source is all about colaboration. Nothing is perfect, and that's ok! [Done is better than perfect](https://twitter.com/lettershoppe/status/897213248260460544), so get it up on GitHub! Your code lives in the repository along with these text documents.

5. Link out to a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide that will show people how they can help. 

6. If your project is going to involve people, get everyone on the same page with a [CODEOFCONDUCT.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

7. Is this just the beginning for your project? Write a [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to let contributors know where the project is going!
