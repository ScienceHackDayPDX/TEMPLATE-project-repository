# TEMPLATE-project-repository
1. Clone this repository to kickstart documenting your Science Hack Day PDX 2017 project

2. Create an Issue in the Science Hack Day repository, and fill out the template form to link us to your project. 

3. Write a README.md document that describes your project. 
- What did you do?
- What equipment, tools, software, and/or hardware did you use?
- Who is this project for?
- Can others contribute to your project?
- Remember the confetti cannon - it's so sad when you find a confetti cannon but no one knows how to use it. Tradegies like these can be avoided by writing great documentation as you go!

4. Don't be shy about sharing your code, project plan, or designs! Open Source is all about colaboration. Nothing is perfect, and that's ok! [Done is better than perfect](https://twitter.com/lettershoppe/status/897213248260460544), so get it up on GitHub! Your code lives in the repository along with these text documents.

5. Link out to a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide that will show people how they can help. 

6. If your project is going to involve people, get everyone on the same page with a [CODEOFCONDUCT.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

7. Is this just the beginning for your project? Write a [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to let contributors know where the project is going!
