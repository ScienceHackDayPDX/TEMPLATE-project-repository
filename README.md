# TEMPLATE-project-repository
Clone this repository to kickstart documenting your Science Hack Day PDX 2017 project

Then write a README.md document that describes your project. 
- What did you do?
- What equipment, tools, software, and/or hardware did you use?
- Who is this project for?
- Can others contribute to your project?

Don't be shy about sharing your code! Open Source is all about colaboration. Nothing is perfect, and that's ok! [Done is better than perfect](https://twitter.com/lettershoppe/status/897213248260460544), so get it up on GitHub!

Link out to a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide that will show people how they can help. 

If your project is going to involve people, get everyone on the same page with a [CODEOFCONDUCT.md](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/TEMPLATE-project-repository/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Is this just the beginning for your project? Write a ROADMAP.md to let contributors know where the project is going!
